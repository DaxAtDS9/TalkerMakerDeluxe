A FOSS Non-Linear Game Dialogue Editor

This system is designed to work with Dialogue System in Unity, specifically, but exports to a simple XML and JSON format that you can do anything you like with.

Currently, the plan is to bring the tool to a usable state so that I can quickly create dialogue for my current game project.

Fork it, fix it, do whatever. I'll gladly roll in code changes.
